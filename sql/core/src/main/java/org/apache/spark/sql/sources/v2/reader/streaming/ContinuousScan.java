 * A {@link Scan} for streaming queries with micro-batch mode.
 *
 * The execution engine will get an instance of {@link Table} first, then call
 * {@link Table#newScanConfigBuilder(DataSourceOptions)} and create an instance of
 * {@link ScanConfig}. The {@link ScanConfigBuilder} can apply operator pushdown and keep the
 * pushdown result in {@link ScanConfig}. Then
 * {@link SupportsContinuousRead#createContinuousInputStream(String, ScanConfig, DataSourceOptions)}
 * will be called to create a {@link ContinuousInputStream} instance. The
 * {@link ContinuousInputStream} manages offsets and creates a {@link ContinuousScan} instance for
 * the duration of the streaming query or until {@link ContinuousInputStream#needsReconfiguration()}
 * returns true. The {@link ContinuousScan} will be used to create input partitions and reader
 * factory to scan data with a Spark job for its duration. At the end {@link InputStream#stop()}
 * will be called when the streaming execution is completed. Note that a single query may have
 * multiple executions due to restart or failure recovery.
