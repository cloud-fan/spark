 * {@link ScanConfig}. The {@link ScanConfigBuilder} can apply operator pushdown and keep the
 * pushdown result in {@link ScanConfig}. Then
 * {@link SupportsMicroBatchRead#createMicroBatchInputStream(String, ScanConfig, DataSourceOptions)}
 * will be called to create a {@link MicroBatchInputStream} instance. The
 * {@link MicroBatchInputStream} manages offsets and creates a {@link MicroBatchScan} instance for
 * for micro-batch. The {@link MicroBatchScan} will be used to create input partitions and
 * reader factory to scan a micro-batch with a Spark job. At the end {@link InputStream#stop()}
 * will be called when the streaming execution is completed. Note that a single query may have
 * multiple executions due to restart or failure recovery.
